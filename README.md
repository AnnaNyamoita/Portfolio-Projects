## Repository Structure
To enhance navigation and organization, the repository is structured into the following directories:

Data Visualizations: A collection of visually appealing and informative data visualizations created using various libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.).
Data Interview Projects: A curated set of projects designed to mirror real-world data challenges and interview questions.
End-to-End Projects: Comprehensive projects demonstrating the entire data science lifecycle, from data acquisition to model deployment.
Data Visualizations
This directory houses a variety of data visualizations that effectively communicate insights from different datasets. Each visualization is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the underlying data, the chosen visualization technique, and the key takeaways.

## Key areas covered:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) visualizations
Statistical visualizations
Interactive visualizations
Geographic visualizations
Custom visualizations
Data Interview Projects
This section contains projects tailored to simulate data science and machine learning interview scenarios. These projects focus on problem-solving, data manipulation, statistical analysis, and model building under time constraints.
